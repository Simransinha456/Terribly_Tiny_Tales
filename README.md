I have created a profile screen that is designed to be visible in various modes, including desktop mode and responsive mode for different mobile devices. The screen consists of three components: Nav, Profile, and Records. The mobile view has been tested on devices such as iPhone SE, iPhone XR, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max

Here are some examples of different mobile devices.
